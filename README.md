Analog Bandwidth Meter
======================

The goal of this project is to provide the code to build your own physical bandwidth meter so that you can see how much bandwidth is being used at any given point in time without having to log into anything. Very handy for a quick assesment of why that streaming movie might be having issues. Stay tuned for future updates.
